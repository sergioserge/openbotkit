## Git Branch Rules

  - No slashes in branch names (e.g., use `fix-something` not `fix/something`).

## Git Commit Rules

  - Commit after every small, atomic change. Each commit should touch 1-3 files max.
  - Use conventional commit format: `feat|fix|refactor|docs|test|chore|ci(scope): message`
  - Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Always stage specific files by name.
  - Keep commits small: aim for under 20 lines changed per commit.
  - Don't batch multiple unrelated changes into one commit.
  - Commit early and often — a working 5-line change is better than a pending 200-line change.

## Database

Path: `~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db`

## Schema

Full database schema: see schema.sql in this skill directory.

## Query patterns

```bash
# List chats
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT jid, name, is_group, last_message_at FROM whatsapp_chats ORDER BY last_message_at DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Recent messages in a chat
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT timestamp, sender_name, text FROM whatsapp_messages WHERE chat_jid = '<jid>' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 30;"

# Search messages by text
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT timestamp, sender_name, text FROM whatsapp_messages WHERE LOWER(text) LIKE '%keyword%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Messages from a specific person
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT timestamp, text FROM whatsapp_messages WHERE LOWER(sender_name) LIKE '%name%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20;"

# My sent messages
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT timestamp, chat_jid, text FROM whatsapp_messages WHERE is_from_me = 1 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Group messages
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT m.timestamp, m.sender_name, m.text FROM whatsapp_messages m JOIN whatsapp_chats c ON c.jid = m.chat_jid WHERE c.name LIKE '%group name%' ORDER BY m.timestamp DESC LIMIT 30;"

# Messages with media
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT timestamp, sender_name, media_type, media_path FROM whatsapp_messages WHERE media_type IS NOT NULL AND media_type != '' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Message count per chat
sqlite3 ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT c.name, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM whatsapp_messages m JOIN whatsapp_chats c ON c.jid = m.chat_jid GROUP BY m.chat_jid ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

# Look up a contact by name
sqlite3 -header -column ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT jid, phone, full_name, push_name, business_name FROM whatsapp_contacts WHERE LOWER(full_name) LIKE '%name%' OR LOWER(push_name) LIKE '%name%' OR LOWER(first_name) LIKE '%name%';"

# Look up a contact by phone number
sqlite3 -header -column ~/.obk/whatsapp/data.db "SELECT jid, phone, full_name, push_name FROM whatsapp_contacts WHERE phone LIKE '%number%';"
```

Always use `-header -column` or `-json` mode for readable output.

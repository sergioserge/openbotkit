# OpenBotKit

A DIY kit for building your own AI assistant. Runs on your machine, talks to your data, answers to you.

## Why

Most AI assistants are meals — pre-cooked, opinionated, served through someone else's kitchen. You eat what you're given. Your data passes through their servers. Their defaults become your constraints. When something breaks or doesn't fit, you can't open the hood.

OpenBotKit is a meal kit. You get the raw ingredients — data connectors, a sync engine, a local database, a CLI, and assistant scaffolding — and you assemble the assistant yourself. You decide which data sources to connect. You decide what the assistant can see and do. You control the recipe.

### What this means in practice

- **Your data stays on your machine.** Emails, messages, and notes sync into local SQLite databases under `~/.obk/`. Nothing leaves your device unless you explicitly send it.
- **No intermediary.** `obk` connects directly to Gmail's API, WhatsApp's protocol, and Apple Notes on your Mac. There is no relay server, no cloud sync layer, no third-party backend.
- **You see every action.** The assistant runs through Claude Code. Every database query, every message sent, every command executed — you see it and can approve it. No autonomous loops running behind your back.
- **You own the code.** It's a Go binary and a set of SQLite files. Fork it, extend it, rip out what you don't need.

## What's in the kit

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Sources** | Connectors for Gmail, WhatsApp, Apple Notes, and conversation memory |
| **Sync engine** | Background daemon (launchd/systemd) keeps your local data fresh |
| **CLI** (`obk`) | Search, read, and send across all sources from the terminal |
| **Assistant scaffolding** | Pre-configured Claude Code setup with skills for natural-language access |
| **Go library** | Import `openbotkit/source/*` to build your own tools and integrations |

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/priyanshujain/openbotkit@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshujain/openbotkit.git
cd openbotkit && make install
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Guided setup — pick your sources, authenticate, run first sync
obk setup

# Or configure manually:
obk config init
obk gmail auth login          # OAuth2 browser flow
obk gmail sync
obk whatsapp auth login       # scan QR code
obk whatsapp sync

# Check what's connected
obk status
```

## Building Your Assistant

OpenBotKit ships an `assistant/` directory — a ready-to-use Claude Code workspace with skills wired to your synced data.

```bash
# Symlink outside the repo (avoids loading dev-only CLAUDE.md)
ln -s /path/to/openbotkit/assistant ~/assistant
cd ~/assistant && claude
```

From there you can ask things like:

- *"Do I have any unread emails from Stripe?"*
- *"Tell David I'll be 10 minutes late"* (sends via WhatsApp)
- *"Draft a reply to the invoice email from yesterday"*
- *"What did we discuss about the API redesign last week?"*
- *"Find my notes about the Berlin trip"*

Each skill is a plain text file containing SQL patterns and CLI commands. Readable, auditable, modifiable. No magic. See [`assistant/`](assistant/) for setup details.

## Library Usage

OpenBotKit is also a Go library. Import the source packages to build your own tools.

```go
import (
    "github.com/priyanshujain/openbotkit/source/gmail"
    "github.com/priyanshujain/openbotkit/store"
)

db, _ := store.Open(store.SQLiteConfig("gmail.db"))
gmail.Migrate(db)

g := gmail.New(gmail.Config{
    CredentialsFile: "credentials.json",
    TokenDBPath:     "tokens.db",
})

result, _ := g.Sync(ctx, db, gmail.SyncOptions{Full: false})

emails, _ := gmail.ListEmails(db, gmail.ListOptions{
    From:  "someone@example.com",
    Limit: 10,
})
```

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.obk/config.yaml` (override with `OBK_CONFIG_DIR`):

```yaml
gmail:
  credentials_file: ~/.obk/gmail/credentials.json
  download_attachments: false
  storage:
    driver: sqlite    # or "postgres"
    dsn: ""           # postgres DSN; sqlite path auto-derived

whatsapp:
  storage:
    driver: sqlite

memory:
  storage:
    driver: sqlite

applenotes:
  storage:
    driver: sqlite
```

### Data directory
